MUlti Stream and InterfaCeS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description of the problem:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The software is mainy to allow a client to connect over multiple interfaces on which the server might be listening. This operation must be synchronized over all connections.

Whatever data that is transferred from the server to the client over the multiple interfaces  must be transmitted with reference to the multiple stream that are involved in the connection so that the data can be reassembled at the client without any errors.

To think about this problem we need to think of a list of requirements that must be considered in  the Server and Client design.

Usecase Scenario and Acceptance tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The server(S) listens at a port(45000). On receiving a connection request from a client(C) the following handshake protocol performed.
   * The server creates a Unique ID as a session id for the client.
   * The Client Sends a GET request for a particular file.
   * On receiving the request the server checks the file size of the requested file. 
   * If the file size is greater than Eg. 2MB, server sends a CREATE N CONNECT requests to the client. 
   * The client then creates N more connections to the server and sends the unique ID for authentication and authorization.
   * The server then splits the file and sends the file to all client connections separately.
