CHAPTER 1

Instant Hacking: The Basics
It’s time to start hacking. 1 In this chapter, you learn how to take control of your computer by
speaking a language it understands: Python. Nothing here is particularly difficult, so if you know
the basic principles of how your computer works, you should be able to follow the examples and
try them out yourself. I’ll go through the basics, startiwng with the excruciatingly simple, but
because Python is such a powerful language, you’ll soon be able to do pretty advanced things.
First, I show you how to get the software you need. Then I tell you a bit about algorithms
and their main components. Throughout these sections, there are numerous small examples
(most of them using only simple arithmetic) that you can try out in the Python interactive
interpreter (covered in the section “The Interactive Interpreter” in this chapter). You learn
about variables, functions, and modules, and after handling these topics, I show you how to
write and run larger programs. Finally, I deal with strings, an important aspect of almost any
Python program.
Installing Python
Before you can start programming, you need some new software. What follows is a short
description of how to download and install Python. If you want to jump into the installation
process without detailed guidance, you can simply visit http://www.python.org/download to
get the most recent version of Python.
