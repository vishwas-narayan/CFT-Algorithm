Holds the code for the Client Application.

Brief summary of the functionality involved:

The client application basically tries to connect to the server on one of the 
interfaces on which the server is listening. A request is made to get a file 
from the server and an initial request is made to connect on all available
interfaces that the server listens on. After the connection is made the client 
requests for the file and transmission begins from server to client on all 
available interfaces.
